Local Mode enables you enables you to monitor and configure logging for Flex Gateway APIs independent of Anypoint Platform.

Get started monitoring Flex Gateway running in Local Mode with the following tasks:

* xref:flex-local-view-manage-logs.adoc[View and Manage Log Output] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure log output for Fluent Bit output Types. Logs outputs types, such as `File` and `HTTP`, services are configure via a configuration YAML file.
* xref:flex-local-third-party-logs-config.adoc[Configure Flex Gateway Logs for Third-Party Services] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure log output for consumption by third-party services such as Splunk. Logs for Third-Party services are configure via a configuration YAML file.
* xref:flex-local-view-logs[View Logs] - Flex Gateway maintains standard output logs regardless of logging configuration. Use the standard output logs for quick logging checks where an additional logging output is not needed, such as ensuring an external service is running or API requests are reaching Flex Gateway.
