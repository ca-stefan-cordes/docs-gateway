Flex Gateway supports three basic deployment models, which apply to both Connected Mode and Local Mode:

* Standalone
* Ingress
* Sidecar

The deployment models in this overview use Kubernetes terminology, but you can extend the deployment models to other technological stacks that have the appropriate network controls applied.

== Standalone Deployment

In a standalone deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service that protects one or more integration API flows by managing internal traffic. In this type of deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications:

In the diagram, all external traffic passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Ingress Deployment

In an ingress deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service that protects applications by managing incoming requests. In this type of deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications. An ingress deployment is similar to a standalone deployment, but traffic in an ingress deployment comes from external services.

In the diagram, all external traffic passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway, before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Sidecar Deployment
In sidecar deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in the same pod as the service it is protecting. Each Flex Gateway deployment exclusively protects the APIs exposed by its protected service. A new Flex Gateway replica is added with each new protected service.

In the diagram, traffic passes from the load balancer, to Flex Gateway, then the consumer application. Flex Gateway and the consumer application are both in the same pod.
