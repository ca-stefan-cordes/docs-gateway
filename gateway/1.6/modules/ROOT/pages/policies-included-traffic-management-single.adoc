[NOTE]
====
The following information applies only to Flex Gateway running in Local Mode. To configure an upstream service for Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode, refer to xref:api-manager::create-instance-task-flex.adoc[Adding a Flex Gateway API Instance in Connected Mode].
====

== Summary

Flex Gateway running in Local Mode supports API instances that expose single upstream services through a single consumer endpoint. For information about exposing multiple upstream services, refer to xref:policies-included-traffic-management.adoc[].

To allow routing requests to a Service when an `ApiInstance` does not include `spec.services`, you must define a `PolicyBinding` configuration with the Traffic Management for Single Upstream Service (`route`) policy. You do not need to configure a Traffic Management for Single Upstream Service (`route`) policy if a custom policy is managing requests.

== Configuring Policy Parameters

Refer to the following policy definition and table of parameters:

----
policyRef:
  name: route
config:
  destinationPath: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "/"
  destinationRef:
      name: <string> // REQUIRED
      kind: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: "Service"
      namespace: <string> // OPTIONAL, default: ""
rules:
  - path: <URL-regex> // OPTIONAL, Example: (.*)
    methods: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL, Example: GET|POST
    headers:
      <header-name>: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL
    host: <regex-string> // OPTIONAL
----

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Parameter | Required or Optional | Default Value | Description

| `destinationPath`
| Optional
| "/"
| Path of the upstream service

| `destinationRef.name`
| Required
| N/A
| Name of the upstream service as defined in the `Service` configuration resource

| `destinationRef.kind`
| Optional
| "Service"
|

| `destinationRef.namespace`
| Optional
| ""
|

| `rules`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array of rulesets for this route. +
Each route can support multiple rulesets.

| `rules.path`
| Optional
| Empty
| Request path that the route can service. +
You can define only one â€œURI Template Regex" path for each ruleset. Only requests with the defined path are sent to this route.

| `rules.methods`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array that defines the types of request methods that the route can service. +
You can select multiple methods for each ruleset. Only requests that are one of the defined methods are sent to this route. Supported values are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`, and `CONNECT`.

| `rules.headers`
| Optional
| Empty
| Array that defines what headers and regular expression value must be present for this route to service the request. +
Only requests that meet all of the specified header requirements are sent to this route. Additional headers present in the request that are not specifically defined in the rules are ignored.

| `rules.host`
| Optional
| Empty
| Request host URL that the route can service. +
You can define only one host URL for each ruleset. Only requests made from the defined host are sent to this route.

=== Resource Configuration Example

The following example defines a rate limit of three requests every six seconds:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: ApiInstance
metadata:
  name: ingress-http
spec:
  address: http://0.0.0.0:8080/api # [1] ApiInstance.address.path
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: ingress-httpbin-route
spec:
  targetRef:
    name: ingress-http
  policyRef:
    name: route
  config:
    destinationPath: /orders # [2] PolicyBinding(route).config.destinationPath
    destinationRef:
      name: orders-svc
  rules:
  - path: /foo(/.*) # [3] PolicyBinding(route).rules.path
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: gateway.mulesoft.com/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: orders-svc
spec:
  address: https://orders.svc.local:443/

// == How This Policy Works
//
// The Traffic Management policy directs traffic to different sets of upstream services by using multiple routes with a defined route order and individual rulesets to direct traffic to different sets of upstream services.
//
// In the following diagram, different routes manage requests to flight information databases and to a customer service application. Route one has two upstream services defined, which directs 70% of requests to a stable database and 30% of requests to a beta database.
//
// image:multiple-upstreams.png[Flex Gateway manages the traffic to multiple upstream services.]
//
// To achieve this configuration, bind two `route-weighted` resources to the exposed API instance. One `route-weighted` resource directs traffic to the flight information database, and the other `route-weighted` resource directs traffic to the customer service application.
//
// === Upstream Services
//
// You can use multiple upstream services in a single route to direct requests to similar services. For example, to test the performance of a new beta upstream service without sending all traffic to the new service, you can direct half of the traffic to a stable upstream service and half to the new upstream service.
//
// The upstream service within the route that each request is sent to is random and independent of any previous request. The `routes.weight` value defines the chance of a request being sent to a particular upstream service. The percentage of traffic sent to that upstream service is the upstream's `routes.weight` divided by the total weight of all upstream services. For example, if there are two upstream services with weight `1`, each receives 50% of the traffic to that route. If the weight values are `1` and `3`, one route would receive 25% of traffic and the other 75%.
//
// Because any upstream service within a route can receive any request, all upstream services within the same route must adhere to the same API contract.
//
//
// === Route Rules
//
// You can direct requests to different routes by using route rules. Requests must meet the rules for only one of the rulesets in the route.
//
// Rulesets refer to any combination of the four rules: `path`, `method`, `headers`, and `host`. You can use multiple rulesets to support different combinations of rules.
//
// All rules are optional. If a rule is not included in a ruleset, that rule is ignored. For example, not specifying a host means that the route can service any host if the request meets the other route rules. Not defining any rule means that the route can service every request.
//
// If a request does not meet the rules for any route, Flex Gateway returns a `404` error code.
//
// === Route Order
//
// In addition to using route rules, you can direct requests to different routes by using policy ordering.
//
// To order policies, see xref:policies-reorder.adoc[]
//
// Setting the policy order sets the order in which traffic is directed to the routes. Flex Gateway directs requests to the first route if the request meets one of the route rulesets. Therefore, route ordering is very important when a request can meet the route rules of multiple routes.
//
// For example, in a configuration in which route one has the `GET` method defined as a rule and route two has no route rules defined, all `GET` requests are sent to route one and all other requests are sent to route two. If the route order was reversed and route one had no route rules, Flex Gateway would direct all requests to route one before any `GET` requests could reach route two.
