Local Mode enables you enables you to monitor Flex Gateway APIs independent of Anypoint Platform. For Flex Gateways running in local mode, you can configure different Fluent Bit logs.

Get started monitoring Flex Gateway running in Local Mode with the following tasks:

* xref:flex-local-third-party-logs-config.adoc[Configure Logs for Flex Gateway in Local Mode] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure log output for Fluent Bit output types. Logs outputs types, such as `File`, `HTTP`, `Splunk`. Logs for Third-Party servicesservices are configure via a configuration YAML file.
* xref:flex-local-view-logs[View Logs] - Flex Gateway maintains standard output logs regardless of logging configuration. Use the standard output logs for quick logging checks where an additional logging output is not needed, such as ensuring an external service is running or API requests are reaching Flex Gateway.
