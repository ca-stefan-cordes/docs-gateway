You can install Flex Gateway as a Linux service, in a Docker container, or as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.

* If you want to run your Flex Gateway inside of a virtual machine (VM), install
it as a Linux service. 
* If you want try the product quickly or demonstrate some of the product's capabilities in a non-production
scenario, install it in a Docker container.
* If you want use Flex Gateway as a load balancer at the edge of a Kubernetes cluster,
install it as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.

[[install]]
=== Run the Installation Commands

. Create the namespace in which Flex Gateway will be installed: 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
kubectl create namespace gateway
----

. You should see three new files where you executed the <<run-registration-command,registration command>>, similar to the following:
+
`e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.conf`
+
`e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.key`
+
`e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.pem`
+
Create a Kubernetes secret from these files:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
kubectl -n gateway create secret generic e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4 \
--from-file=platform.conf=e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.conf \
--from-file=platform.key=e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.key \
--from-file=platform.pem=e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4.pem
----

. Using Ingress, install the *flex-gateway* Helm chart into the *gateway* namespace. Specify the UUID from the filenames mentioned in the previous step. 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --wait ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway \
--set registerSecretName=e1bd8346-51f2-4a4b-b421-7e0ed57e98d4 \
--devel
----
+
The command returns something similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
NAME: ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Oct 19 13:08:07 2021
NAMESPACE: gateway
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
----

. Verify *apiinstances* was created during installation: 
+
[source,text]
----
kubectl -n gateway get apiinstances
---- 
+
The command returns output similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
NAME            ADDRESS
ingress-http    http://0.0.0.0:80
ingress-https   http://0.0.0.0:443
