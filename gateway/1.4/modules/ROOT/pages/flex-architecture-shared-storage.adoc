When configuring shared storage, MuleSoft recommends placing the Redis service as close to Flex Gateway as possible. 

[NOTE]
----
To configure the connection between Flex Gateway and the shared storage service, see:
* xref:flex-conn-shared-storage.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Connected Mode]
* xref:flex-local-shared-storage.adoc[Configure Shared Storage in Connected Mode]
----

You can place the within the Kubernetes cluster as Flex Gateway or as a public cloud service instantiated within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as Flex Gateway.
