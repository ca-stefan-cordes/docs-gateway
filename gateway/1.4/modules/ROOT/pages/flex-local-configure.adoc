// * xref:flex-local-rep-run.adoc[Configure Replicas] - Anypoint Flex Gateway enables you to create replicas, which are instances of Flex Gateway. By default, Flex Gateway runs as a single replica. Running multiple replicas enables scaling, load balancing, and high availability.
// * xref:flex-local-tls-config.adoc[Configure TLS Context] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure a TLS context to support regular TLS and mTLS in both inbound and outbound directions.
// * xref:flex-local-shared-storage-config.adoc[Configure Shared Storage] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure shared storage for distributed caching and rate limiting policies.
// * xref:flex-local-forward-proxy.adoc[Configure a Forward Proxy] - Flex Gateway enables you to configure a forward proxy to route external HTTP connections through a proxy connection.
// * xref:flex-conn-node-affinity-config.adoc[Configure Node Selection for Deployments on Kubernetes] - Flex Gateway enables you to host the gateway on a specialized node that meets specific requirements, instead of using the nodes that host other deployments.
