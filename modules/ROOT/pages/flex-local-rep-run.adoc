== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure you have completed the following tasks:

* xref:flex-install.adoc[Install a Flex Gateway]
* xref:flex-local-reg-run[Register and Run in Local Mode]

== Add a Flex Replica as a Linux Service

. Copy the three registration files to a directory on your
Linux machine or VM. For example: 

* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.key`
* `6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.pem`

Determine the path where these files live by using the command, `pwd`, then save the path and the UUID,
or name, of the `.conf` file for later use. For example, `/Users/jane/flex-gateway/6eb79785-c2f0-4e06-b574-8a030a321d74.conf`.

== Add a Flex Replica in a Docker Container

To add a Flex Replica in a Docker Container you must run the Flex Gateway start command using the file path and name of the same `.conf` file created during registration. If you are running the container locally, you will also need to use a different port.
