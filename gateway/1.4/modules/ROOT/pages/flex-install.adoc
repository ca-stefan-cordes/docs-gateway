//TODO: Need to clarify what this step is for in each case:
//      For k8 and OpenShift, this is a prerequisite to _registering_ Flex. 
//      It does not install to a k8 cluster.
//
//      Q: In the Linux and Docker cases, are we running the Flex that we 
//         download or just downloading Flex so we can register it? 
You can install Flex Gateway as a Linux service, in a Docker container, or on a Kubernetes cluster.

* If you want to run your Flex Gateway inside a virtual machine (VM), install
it as a Linux service. 
* If you want try the product quickly or demonstrate some of the product's capabilities in a non-production
scenario, install it in a Docker container.
* If you want use Flex Gateway as a load balancer at the edge of a Kubernetes cluster,
install it as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.
//TODO: is this the only installation use case?
* If you want use Flex Gateway as a load balancer at the edge of an OpenShift cluster,
install it as an OpenShift Ingress controller.
