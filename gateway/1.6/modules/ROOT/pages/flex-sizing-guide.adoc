Before getting started with Flex Gateway, you must analyze and choose your configuration to obtain the best performance and auto-scaling rate.

When you build a node, you must consider:

* Number of APIs
* Amount of memory each node needs
* Processing power for each node

NOTE: Nodes belonging to a cluster must be of the same size.

When assigning resources for each node, you must consider some configuration aspects:

* Number of APIs in your environment
* Number of policies in each API
* Amount of traffic each node handles
* Amount of time the node takes to answer the request (latency)
* Type of traffic each node handles, and within the traffic:
** The number of requests per second the node handles
** Size of each request (bytes)

== Choose Appropriate Resources
The following table guides you to know the resources you must allocate to your node according to your environment:

[options="header"]
|====
| Node Size | CPU | RAM 
| Small | 1-2 cores | 2-4 GB
| Medium | 2-4 cores | 4-8 GB
| Large | 8-16 cores | 16-32 GB	
|====

== Choose Your Cluster Size

You can choose the appropriate cluster size with the following guiding table:

[options="header"]
|====
| Node Size | Number of APIs | Number of Policies | Expected Latency | Expected Throughput | Target Environment
| Small | < 100 | 4 | < 100 ms | < 500 RPS | Dev/test cluster
| Medium | < 1000 | 4 | < 20 ms | < 2500 RPS | Production cluster
| Large | < 10000 | 4 | < 10 ms | < 10000 RPS | Mission-critical clusters
|====

Depending on the cluster performance, you can try with the following changes:

* If the cluster delays your requests more than expected, increase its size.
* If the cluster has high CPU consumption, increase its latency.
* If the cluster has high memory consumption, check the OOM errors.

In all cases, the average request size is 1kB and the 4 out-of-the-box policies commonly used are:

* Message logging
* Rate limiting
* JWT validation
* Header Injection

NOTE: Using TLS highly affects the response time and the process consumption.
