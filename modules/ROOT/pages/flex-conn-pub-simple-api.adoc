. In API Manager, click *Manage API* and select *Add new API Wizard*.
. Select Flex Gateway for your runtime.
. Choose the connected Flex Gateway you have installed and registered, and click *Next*.

NOTE: If you see the Flex Gateway you have installed, but it says DISCONNECTED, it
has not been registered. See xref:flex-conn-reg-run.adoc[Register a Flex Gateway] for more information.
. Select the API you have uploaded to Exchange, and click *Next*.

Once the asset is selected, you can choose the version of the asset to manage.
. Enter the *Implementation URI* where you will be redirecting traffic.
. If you have multiple instances of an API, enter an API Instance label.
. (Optional) Enter a Consumer endpoint.
. (Optional) Update the Base Path.
