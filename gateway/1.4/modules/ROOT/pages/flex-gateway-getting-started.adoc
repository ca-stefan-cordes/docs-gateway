The following guide describes how to install, register, and run Anypoint Flex Gateway in Connected Mode - all using Docker. Additionally, the guide describes how to deploy an API Instance with a basic authentication policy.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that Docker is installed.

//Before getting started, ensure that:
//
//* Docker is installed.
//* Required Flex Gateway ports are available and permissions are assigned. For more information see xref:flex-review-prerequisites.adoc[].

== Install Flex Gateway

To install the Flex Gateway Docker image, run the following command in a terminal:

[source,ssh]
----
docker pull mulesoft/flex-gateway:latest
----

== Register Flex Gateway

. Log in to Anypoint Platform with your registered account.
. Select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click on the *Flex Gateways* tab in the side navigation panel.
. Click *Add Gateway*.
. Select *Docker* and copy the code block in the *Register your gateway* section. The code block will contain your unique organization ID and token.
+
The following screenshot of the *Add a Flex Gateway* page highlights the code block that should be copied.
+

. Run the copied code block in a terminal, making sure to replace `<gateway-name>` with a name, such as `flex-quickstart-guide`.
. Select *Flex Gateways* in the side navigation panel.
+
Your registered Flex Gateway now appears in the list of gateways.

== Run Flex Gateway

To run Flex Gateway, execute the following command in a terminal:

[source,ssh]
----
docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/usr/local/share/mulesoft/flex-gateway/conf.d \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -p 8082:8082 \
  mulesoft/flex-gateway
----

== Deploy an API Instance

. Select *API Manager* from the Anypoint Platform menu.
. Click *Add API*, followed by *Add new API*.
+

. In the *Add API* page, select *Flex Gateway* as your runtime.
. Select your registered gateway that is listed in the *Select a Gateway* section.
. Click *Next*.
+
The following screenshot of the *Add API* page highlights the specified options.
+
image::gateway-quickstart-select-gateway-for-api.png["Screenshot of 'Select Gateway for API'",width=95%]

. Click *Create New API*.
. Specify an API name and select *HTTP API* as the asset type.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Endpoint* page, enter the following for *Implementation URI*:
+
[source]
----
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
----
. For *Port*, enter `8082`.
. Click *Next*.
+
The following screenshot of the *Endpoint* page highlights the specified options.
+
image::gateway-quickstart-select-endpoint.png["Screenshot of 'Endpoint' page",width=95%]

. Click *Save & Deploy*.
+
Inside the gateway instance Docker container, all HTTP requests made to `localhost` on port `8082` will now be proxied to the `jsonplaceholder` service.
. To test the API Instance, run the following command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/'
----
+
The command executes a `GET` request to the API Instance, and subsequently prints the resulting status code, which should be `200`.

== Apply a Policy

. While still in *API Manager*, select *API Administration* in the side navigation panel.
. Select the highlighted name of the API Instance created in the previous section.
. Select *Policies* in the side navigation panel.
. In the *Policies* page, click *Add policy*.
+
The following screenshot of the *Policies* page highlights the specified options.
+
image::gateway-quickstart-add-policy.png["Screenshot of 'Add Policy'",width=60%]

. Select the *Basic Authentication - Simple* policy.
. Click *Next*.
. For *User Name*, enter `user`.
. For *User Password*, enter `password`.
. Click *Apply*.
+
The following screenshot of the *Configure Basic Authentication policy* page highlights the specified options.
+
image::gateway-quickstart-config-basic-auth.png["Screenshot of 'Configure Basic Auth Policy'",width=60%]

. To test the API Instance _without_ authentication, run the previous `curl` command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/'
----
+
The command prints a resulting `401 (Unauthorized)` status code, because the request does not include the Authentication context.
. To test the API Instance _with_ authentication, run the following command in a terminal:
+
[source,ssh]
----
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --request GET 'http://localhost:8082/' -u user:password
----
+
The command prints the resulting status code, which should be `200`.
