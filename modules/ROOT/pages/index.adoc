Anypoint Flex Gateway is a next-generation lightweight gateway designed for distributed APIs and microservices. Its small footprint provides flexibility on where it can be installed and how it is used. Flex Gateway easily auto-discovers, manages, protects, and serves as a standalone proxy for any API, including non-Mule APIs.

Install Flex Gateway as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller, as an Ubuntu Service, or as a Docker Container Image. You can immediately start applying out-of-the-box policies to APIs, via declarative configuration files.

Flex Gateway supports the following: 

* REST APIs - interfaces that follow a synchronous request/response model.
* HTTP/1.1 protocol
* HTTP/2 protocol

The following diagram illustrates a typical Flex Gateway deployment in a Kubernetes cluster:
