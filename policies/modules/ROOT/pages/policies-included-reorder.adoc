In Flex Gateway Connected Mode and Mule Gateway, you configure the order of execution of included policies via *API Manager*. The following steps demonstrate this.

In Local Mode, you configure policy ordering via a `PolicyBinding` YAML resource. For information about Local Mode policy order, see the xref:gateway::flex-local-configuration-reference-guide.adoc#policy-binding[Declarative Configuration Reference Guide].

To reorder a policy for Flex Gateway Connected Mode or Mule Gateway:

. In Anypoint Platform, select *API Manager > API Administration* and then click the API version or instance.

. From the left navigation menu, select *Policies*.

. From the top of the list of the applied policies, click *Edit Policy Order*.

. From the *Reorder Applied Policies* section, either drag the *Policy Card* or use the up and down arrows to rearrange the order of policies.

. Click *Apply order*.
