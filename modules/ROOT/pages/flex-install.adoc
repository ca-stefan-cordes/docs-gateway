You can install Flex Gateway as a Linux service, in a Docker container, or as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.

* If you want to run your Flex Gateway inside of a virtual machine (VM), install
it as a Linux service. 
* If you want try the product quickly or demonstrate some of the product's capabilities in a non-production
scenario, install it in a Docker container.
* If you want use Flex Gateway as a load balancer at the edge of a Kubernetes cluster,
install it as a Kubernetes Ingress controller.

== Install as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller

The process of installing Flex Gateway as a Kubernetes Ingress controller includes the following tasks:

* Install dependencies
* Prepare your environment
* Run the installation commands
* Verify successful installation

=== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that you have installed the following:

* A tool to create Kubernetes clusters. The following examples use https://k3d.io/v5.0.0/#installation[k3d^].
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl^], a tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters.
* https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm^], a tool used to install Flex Gateway, monitoring tools, and applications. A minimum Helm version of 3.0.0 is required.

=== Prepare and Install

. Create a new Kubernetes cluster with a single server node: 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
k3d cluster create flex-gateway-1 \
--k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:*" \
--port '80:80@server:*' \
--port '443:443@server:*'
----
+
The command returns the following success message: 
+
[source,text]
----
INFO[0042] Cluster 'flex-gateway-1' created successfully!
----

. Download the Flex Gateway container image: 
+
[source,ssh,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -o flex-gateway-{gateway-ver-var}.tar \
https://peregrine:48bcfd4617c9cce@d8wbbsqfcfi8u.cloudfront.net/docker/flex-gateway-{gateway-ver-var}.tar
----

. Import the Flex Gateway container image: 
+
[source,kubernetes,subs=attributes+]
----
k3d image import -c flex-gateway-1 flex-gateway-{gateway-ver-var}.tar
----
+
The command returns the following success messages: 
+
[source,text]
----
INFO[0016] Successfully imported image(s)
INFO[0016] Successfully imported 1 image(s) into 1 cluster(s)
----

. Add the Flex Gateway Helm repository: 
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo add flex-gateway https://flex-packages.stgx.anypoint.mulesoft.com/helm
----

. Update the Helm repository using the following command:
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm repo up
----

. Using Ingress, install the *flex-gateway* Helm chart into the *gateway* namespace:  
+
[source,kubernetes]
----
helm -n gateway upgrade -i --wait --create-namespace ingress flex-gateway/flex-gateway
----
+
The command returns something similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
NAME: ingress
LAST DEPLOYED: Tue Oct 19 13:08:07 2021
NAMESPACE: gateway
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1

+
[source,text]
----
kubectl -n gateway get apiinstances
---- 
+
The command returns output similar to the following: 
+
[source,text]
----
