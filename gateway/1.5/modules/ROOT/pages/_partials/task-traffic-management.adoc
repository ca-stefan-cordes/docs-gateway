Flex Gateway running in Local Mode supports API instances with multiple routes and multiple upstreams enabling you to expose multiple backend services through a single consumer endpoint.

When managing traffic for Flex Gateway, routes direct traffic to different sets of upstream services, where as upstreams are different instances of the upstream services.

For example, when a request is made, Flex Gateway first decides what route the request belongs to using route rules. Then, Flex Gateway sends the request to on of the upstream services defined in the route. 

In the following diagram, different routes manage requests to flight information databases and to a customer service application. Route one has two upstream services defined directing 70% of requests to a stable database and 30% of requests to a beta database.
