Flex Gateway supports three deployment models, all of which apply to Connected Mode and Local Mode.

NOTE: This overview uses Kubernetes terminology, but you can extend to other technological stacks with the appropriate network controls applied.

== Standalone Deployment

In standalone deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service to protect one or more integration API flows to manage internal traffic. You deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications.

In the diagram, all external traffic passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Ingress Deployment

In ingress deployment, Flex Gateway acts as a standalone service that protects applications by managing incoming request. You deploy Flex Gateway in a separate pod and namespace from the consumer applications. Ingress deployment is similar to standalone deployment, but traffic in ingress deployment comes from external services.

In the diagram, all external traffic passes through a load balancer before entering the Flex Gateway namespace. The traffic then passes through Flex Gateway, before reaching the consumer application namespace.

== Sidecar Deployment
In sidecar deployment, you deploy Flex Gateway in the same pod as the service it is protecting. Each Flex Gateway deployment exclusively protects the APIs exposed by its protected service. A new Flex Gateway replica is added with each new protected service.

In the diagram, traffic passes from the load balancer, to Flex Gateway, then the consumer application. Flex Gateway and the consumer application are both in the same pod.
