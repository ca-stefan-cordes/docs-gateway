When using Anypoint Flex Gateway in connected mode, you can view your gateways
in Runtime Manager and your API instances and policy configurations in API Manager.

Connected mode enables you to manage all of your non-Mule APIs from a single unified
control plane, and grants you all the other benefits of Anypoint Platform, such as
monitoring through API Analytics and reusability through Exchange.
