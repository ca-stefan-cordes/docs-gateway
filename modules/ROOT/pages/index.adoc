A gateway enables you to manage and secure traffic between clients and microservices. It is a sliver of software that functions as a traffic router - providing a single client-side entry (a URL) to any number of backend API endpoints. A gateway aggregates API endpoint responses and returns one response as consolidated data, thereby creating a simple, cohesive experience for clients.

The following diagram demonstrates a typical Anypoint API Gateway configuration:

== Anypoint Platform Gateways

=== Anypoint Flex Gateway

Flex Gateway is a next-generation lightweight gateway designed for distributed APIs and microservices. Its small footprint provides flexibility on where it can be installed and how it is used. Flex Gateway can serve as a standalone proxy for any API, including non-Mule APIs. 

Use Flex Gateway for easily auto-discovering, managing, and protecting all types of APIs in a Kubernetes cluster.

=== Anypoint Mule Runtime-Embedded Gateway

Mule Runtime-embedded gateway is a robust gateway that requires APIs and proxies to be implemented as Mule Runtime applications. It is typically deployed in the cloud via a fully-managed CloudHub instance, or via Anypoint Studio.

Use Mule Runtime-embedded gateway for deploying Mule APIs in Runtime Fabric.

=== Anypoint Service Mesh

Anypoint Service Mesh is similar to a gateway, but differs in that it primarily manages and secures internal, service-to-service traffic. By contrast, a gateway accepts traffic from outside clients and routes it to relevant services (i.e. client-to-service traffic).

Use Anypoint Service Mesh for fine-grained monitoring and control over a microservices deployment.

== Compatibility Matrix

The following table describes the features that are available on each of the API gateway offerings and targets:
