This document provides recommendations for sizing Flex Gateway resources. As the bridge between your application and backend services, Flex Gateway plays a critical role in managing and controlling the interactions between these components. Therefore, appropriate resource sizing is important for optimal performance and reliability.

The two key factors to consider are the number of APIs deployed, and the number of policies applied. Additional considerations include the throughput of transactions at peak times, and the payload size of the data being sent through the APIs.

Resource sizing recommendations are guidelines based on the following scenarios. Additional benchmarking adjustments should be performed to satisfy specific performance requirements.

== 20 APIs, 2 Policies

- Flex Gateway deployed in a Kubernetes cluster
- 2 replicas
- Load distributed among 200 users
- 100 transactions per second
- Message Logging and JWT Validation policies applied
