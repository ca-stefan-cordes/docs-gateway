Use case three covers all patterns of a non-organization owned API exposed to an organization-owned API consumer.

Use case examples:

* A payments service needs to obtain exchange rates from an external service provider
* An internal API Consumer accesses the organizationâ€™s external ServiceNow instance (SaaS service)

== Pattern 7: External Non-Org API exposed to Internal Org Consumer
In pattern seven, you deploy Flex Gateway as an egress controller. You can use Flex Gateway to monitor, control, and enrich the flows to external services. Additionally, you can rate limit external access and track metrics and analytics.

The following diagram demonstrates the physical implementation of an External Non-Org API exposed to an internal Org Consumer on Kubernetes. The diagram assumes that the firewall terminates the incoming non-org external mTLS connection.

== Pattern 8: External Non-Org API exposed to External Org Consumer
In pattern eight, Flex Gateway acts as an intermediary between two organization external entities. Flex Gateway runs as an ingress and egress controller applying secure communication and policy enforcement.
