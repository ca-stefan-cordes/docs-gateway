For Flex Gateway running in Connected Mode, you publish both API instances with single upstream services and with multiple upstream services by using *API Manager*. 

For how to publish Flex Gateway API instances with API Manager, see xref:api-manager::create-instance-task-flex.adoc[].

Additionally, you can publish a simple API with xref:flex-gateway-getting-started.adoc[].
